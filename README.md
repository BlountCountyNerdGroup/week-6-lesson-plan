Lesson plan for week 6

# Reflections
Everyone generally understood the concept of databases, and they were even catching onto the syntax pretty quickly, but at the same time, there was little room to mess around, and also, we're not going to be using databases in any near-future lessons, so there wasn't too much of a point in introducing them as far as lesson quality, I'm going to say 7/10, but as far as short-term usefulness, I'm going to say 4/10 which means that in the future, we should use this week to focus on objects or arrays and further solidify functions since by the last week, we wanted them to have a good understanding of syntax.
